# Receipts Data Guide

This guide explains how to fetch, paginate, and interpret receipt data from the CommerceOS API for BI and analytics use cases.

---

## Overview

Receipts are immutable records of completed sales at a point of sale. Each receipt captures what was bought, how much was paid, any discounts applied, and taxes charged. Unlike trade orders (which represent pending or in-progress transactions), receipts represent transactions that have already happened.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Immutable after creation:** Receipts cannot be modified via the API once created
- **Importable:** Receipts can be imported via `POST /v1/receipts` for migration or external system integration
- **Timestamped:** Every receipt has a `timestamp` field for chronological ordering
- **Complete:** Each receipt includes items, payments, VAT breakdowns, and optional discounts

---

## Creating (Importing) Receipts

Receipts can be imported into CommerceOS via `POST /v1/receipts`. This is typically used for:
- Migrating historical receipt data from legacy systems
- Importing receipts from external POS systems
- Integration scenarios where receipts are created outside CommerceOS

### Required Fields on Create

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `identifiers.receiptID` | string | Human-readable receipt ID (e.g., `"MPK00000000002"`) |
| `prefix` | string | Store/terminal prefix (e.g., `"MPK"`) |
| `ordinal` | decimal (string) | Sequential number within prefix (e.g., `"1"`) |
| `timestamp` | date-time | Transaction timestamp (read-only after creation) |
| `seller` | agent | Store or company that sold the products |
| `buyer` | agent | Customer or company that purchased |
| `posTerminal` | POS terminal | The POS terminal associated with the receipt |
| `currencyCode` | string | Currency code (e.g., `"SEK"`) |
| `items` | array | At least one receipt item (product, quantity, unitAmount) |

### Optional Fields on Create

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `payments` | array | Payment records (optional in current behavior, but typically expected for POS receipts) |

> **Note:** While `payments` is not enforced as required by the API, most POS receipts include at least one payment record.

### Example Import

```bash
POST /v1/receipts
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "identifiers": { "receiptID": "MPK00000000001" },
    "prefix": "MPK",
    "ordinal": "1",
    "seller": { "identifiers": { "com.example.storeId": "STORE-001" } },
    "buyer": { "identifiers": { "com.example.customerId": "CUST-001" } },
    "posTerminal": { "identifiers": { "com.example.posId": "POS-001" } },
    "currencyCode": "SEK",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-13T09:20:32.710Z",
    "items": [
      {
        "product": { "identifiers": { "com.example.sku": "PHONE-001" } },
        "quantity": "1",
        "unitAmount": "5999.20"
      }
    ],
    "payments": [
      {
        "method": "com.heads.cash",
        "amount": "7499.00",
        "consumerPrintout": "CASH PAYMENT\nAmount: 7499.00 SEK",
        "merchantPrintout": "CASH PAYMENT\nAmount: 7499.00 SEK\nKeep this receipt"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Fetching Receipts

### Base Collection

```bash
# Get all receipts (default ordering, limited by system defaults)
GET /v1/receipts

# Get a single receipt by database key
GET /v1/receipts/{key}

# Get a single receipt by receipt ID
GET /v1/receipts/receiptID=MPK00000000002
```

### Ordering by Timestamp

For BI and analytics, you typically want receipts in chronological order:

```bash
# Latest receipts first (most recent)
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp:desc)~take(200)

# Oldest receipts first
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp)~take(200)
```

### Using Receipt Identifiers

Receipts have special identifiers:

| Identifier | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `key` | Database key (internal, stable) | `6b401deb013d7b07ba8139933e7c9395` |
| `receiptID` | Human-readable ID printed on receipt | `MPK00000000002` |
| `prefix` | Store/terminal prefix | `MPK` |
| `ordinal` | Sequential number within prefix | `"2"` |

```bash
# Lookup by receiptID
GET /v1/receipts/receiptID=MPK00000000002

# Lookup by database key
GET /v1/receipts/6b401deb013d7b07ba8139933e7c9395
```

---

## Pagination at Scale

When exporting large volumes of receipt data, proper pagination is essential.

### Using Operators (Recommended for Complex Queries)

```bash
# Page 1: First 200 receipts
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp:desc)~take(200)

# Page 2: Skip first 200, take next 200
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp:desc)~skip(200)~take(200)

# Page 3: Skip first 400, take next 200
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp:desc)~skip(400)~take(200)
```

### Using Query Parameters (Simple Cases)

```bash
# Page 1
GET /v1/receipts?orderby=timestamp:desc&limit=200

# Page 2
GET /v1/receipts?orderby=timestamp:desc&limit=200&offset=200

# Page 3
GET /v1/receipts?orderby=timestamp:desc&limit=200&offset=400
```

**Query Parameter Normalization**

Query parameters can be mixed with path operators—the system normalizes them into a canonical order:

```
format → fields → where → orderBy → skip → take → simpleJust
```

This means sorting (orderBy) always runs before pagination (skip/take), ensuring consistent results regardless of URL parameter order. For example:

```bash
# These produce equivalent results:
GET /v1/receipts?orderby=timestamp:desc&limit=100&offset=50
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp:desc)~skip(50)~take(100)
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp:desc)?limit=100&offset=50
```

See the [Operators Reference](operators.md#query-parameter-normalization) for details.

### Incremental Pulls by Timestamp

For ongoing BI synchronization, use timestamp-based incremental pulls:

```bash
# Initial full export (oldest first for stable ordering)
GET /v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp)~take(1000)

# Subsequent pulls: receipts after your last sync timestamp
GET /v1/receipts/after/2025-02-13T09:20:32.710Z~orderBy(timestamp)~take(1000)

# Or use the where operator for timestamp filtering
GET /v1/receipts~where(timestamp>2025-02-13T09:20:32.710Z)~orderBy(timestamp)~take(1000)
```

## BI Alignment: Stable Keys for Export

When building BI exports, use these stable fields as keys:

### Receipt-Level Keys

| Field | Stability | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `identifiers.key` | Immutable | Primary key in data warehouse |
| `identifiers.receiptID` | Immutable | Human-readable identifier |
| `timestamp` | Immutable | Partitioning, incremental sync |

### Recommended Export Fields

```bash
# Full receipt with all fields
GET /v1/receipts/{id}?fields=all

# Or using operators
GET /v1/receipts/{id}~withAll
```

**Core fields for BI export:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `identifiers.key` | string | Database key |
| `identifiers.receiptID` | string | Printed receipt ID |
| `seller` | agent | Store or company that sold |
| `buyer` | agent | Customer |
| `timestamp` | date-time | Transaction time |
| `currencyCode` | string | Currency code (e.g., "SEK") |
| `totalAmount` | decimal | Grand total including VAT |
| `totalTaxAmount` | decimal | Total VAT amount |
| `totalDiscountAmount` | decimal | Total discount applied (excluding VAT) |
| `roundingAmount` | decimal | Cash rounding adjustment |
| `totalPayableAmount` | decimal | Amount due |
| `totalPaidAmount` | decimal | Amount paid |
| `totalExternalSettlementsAmount` | decimal | Total amount settled outside POS |
| `vatGroups` | array | VAT breakdown by rate |
| `payments` | array | Payment transactions |
| `externalSettlements` | array | External payments from webshop/invoice |
| `items` | array | Line items |

### VAT Groups Structure

Each VAT group summarizes items at the same tax rate:

```json
{
  "percentage": "25",
  "quantity": "3",
  "netAmount": "800.00",
  "grossAmount": "1000.00",
  "vatAmount": "200.00"
}
```

### Payments Structure

Each payment records a transaction:

```json
{
  "identifiers": {
    "key": "abc123",
    "transactionId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  },
  "paymentType": "PAYMENT",
  "method": "com.heads.card",
  "amount": "1000.00",
  "currencyCode": "SEK",
  "consumerPrintout": "CARD PAYMENT\nAmount: 1000.00 SEK\nCard: ****1234\nApproved",
  "merchantPrintout": "CARD PAYMENT\nAmount: 1000.00 SEK\nCard: ****1234\nApproved\nKeep this receipt"
}
```

**Required fields (on create):**
- `method`: Payment method identifier (string, e.g., `"com.heads.card"`)
- `amount`: Payment amount (positive for payments, negative for refunds)

**Optional fields (on create):**
- `consumerPrintout`: Text printed on customer receipt copy (recommended for display)
- `merchantPrintout`: Text printed on merchant receipt copy (recommended for display)

> **Note:** While `consumerPrintout` and `merchantPrintout` are not enforced by the importer, they are recommended for displaying payment details on receipts.

**Read-only fields (derived at runtime):**
- `paymentType`: Derived from payment direction—`"PAYMENT"` for positive amounts (incoming), `"REFUND"` for negative amounts (outgoing)
- `currencyCode`: Always matches the receipt's currency; derived from the payment record
- `transactionId`: Auto-generated UUID when importing receipts; read-only after creation

### External Settlements Structure

External settlements balance a receipt against payments that happened outside the POS system. Used when an order was partially or fully paid elsewhere—like through a webshop payment or an invoice—before being completed at the register.

```json
{
  "externalSettlements": [
    {
      "amount": "2500.00",
      "referencedPayment": {
        "@type": "payment order",
        "identifiers": {"key": "..."}
      }
    }
  ],
  "totalExternalSettlementsAmount": "2500.00"
}
```

**Fields:**
- `amount`: The settlement amount
- `referencedPayment`: Optional reference to the payment order this settlement corresponds to

**Accessing external settlements:**

```bash
# Get external settlements for a receipt
GET /v1/receipts/{id}/externalSettlements

# Get the total
GET /v1/receipts/{id}/totalExternalSettlementsAmount
```

---

## Discounts

Discounts are stored at the **item level**, not at the receipt level. Each receipt item can have multiple discounts, and discount amounts are reported excluding VAT.

### Where Discounts Live

```
receipt.items[].discounts[]
```

### Discount Structure

```json
{
  "reason": {
    "identifiers": {"key": "..."},
    "name": "Employee Discount",
    "active": true
  },
  "amount": "50.00"
}
```

### Extracting Per-Item Discounts

```bash
# Get receipt with items expanded
GET /v1/receipts/{id}~with(items)
```

> **Note:** Receipt item subpaths for `discounts`/`instances` are currently unsupported, and subpaths like `manualNotes` also error. Use `~with(items)` and read `items[].discounts`/`items[].instances` from the expanded items instead.

### Calculating Total Discounts

The receipt provides a pre-calculated total (excluding VAT):

```bash
GET /v1/receipts/{id}/totalDiscountAmount
```

Or calculate from items:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Product A",
      "discountAmount": "25.00",
      "discounts": [
        {"reason": {"name": "Loyalty"}, "amount": "25.00"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Product B",
      "discountAmount": "50.00",
      "discounts": [
        {"reason": {"name": "Promo"}, "amount": "30.00"},
        {"reason": {"name": "Staff"}, "amount": "20.00"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "totalDiscountAmount": "75.00"
}
```

---

## Instances (IMEI/Serial Data)

Instance tracking data (currently mobile device IMEI numbers) is stored at the item level.

### Where Instances Live

```
receipt.items[].instances[]
```

### Instance Structure

For mobile devices, instances contain IMEI data:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "description": "Samsung Galaxy S24",
      "product": {"identifiers": {"key": "..."}},
      "instances": [
        {
          "@type": "mobile device",
          "identifiers": {"key": "..."},
          "imei": "123456789012345"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Accessing Instance Data

To access instance data, expand items on the receipt:

```bash
# Get receipt with items expanded (includes instances)
GET /v1/receipts/{id}~with(items)
```

> **Note:** Direct item subpaths like `/v1/receipts/{id}/items/0/instances` and `/v1/receipts/{id}/items/0/discounts` are currently unsupported, and subpaths like `manualNotes` also error. Use `~with(items)` and read the `instances` array from each item in the response.

### Instance Types

Instances can be of different types depending on the product, but only mobile devices are currently surfaced:
- **Mobile devices:** Include `imei` field
- **Other tracked products:** Instance data is not currently returned in receipts

---

## Finder and Relative Access

The receipts collection provides utility endpoints for time-based queries.

### Before/After Timestamps

```bash
# Receipts created before a specific time
GET /v1/receipts/before/2025-02-13T00:00:00.000Z

# Receipts created after a specific time
GET /v1/receipts/after/2025-02-13T00:00:00.000Z
```

These return receipt collections that can be further filtered and paginated:

```bash
# Receipts after a timestamp, ordered and paginated
GET /v1/receipts/after/2025-02-13T00:00:00.000Z~orderBy(timestamp)~take(100)
```

### Receipt Finder

> **Note:** `POST /v1/receipts/@find` is currently unsupported. Use `/v1/receipts/after/{timestamp}` or `~where(timestamp>...)` instead.

For timestamp-based filtering, use the before/after endpoints shown above, or the `~where` operator:

```bash
# Using the after endpoint (recommended for incremental sync)
GET /v1/receipts/after/2025-02-13T00:00:00.000Z~orderBy(timestamp)~take(100)

# Using the where operator
GET /v1/receipts~where(timestamp>2025-02-13T00:00:00.000Z)~orderBy(timestamp)~take(100)
```

---

## Example: Complete BI Export Query

```bash
# Step 1: Get receipts for a date range with all fields
GET /v1/receipts/after/2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z~orderBy(timestamp)~take(500)~withAll

# Step 2: For each receipt, extract:
# - identifiers.key (primary key)
# - identifiers.receiptID (display key)
# - timestamp (partition key)
# - seller.identifiers (store ID)
# - buyer.identifiers (customer ID, if known)
# - totalAmount, totalTaxAmount, totalDiscountAmount
# - vatGroups[] (for tax reporting)
# - payments[] (for payment method analysis)
# - items[].discounts[] (for discount analysis)
# - items[].instances[] (for serial/IMEI tracking)
```

### Streaming Large Exports

For large exports, use NDJSON format for streaming:

```bash
# Stream receipts as newline-delimited JSON
curl -H "Accept: application/x-ndjson" \
  "https://your-tenant.api/v1/receipts~orderBy(timestamp)~take(10000)"
```

Or use CSV for tabular export:

```bash
# Export as CSV (flattened structure)
curl -H "Accept: text/csv" \
  "https://your-tenant.api/v1/receipts~just(identifiers,timestamp,totalAmount,currencyCode)~take(10000)"
```
