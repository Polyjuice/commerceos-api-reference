# CommerceOS API Reference

Comprehensive documentation for integrating with the **CommerceOS REST API**. This reference covers HTTP usage, authentication, pagination, query operators, content negotiation, and common workflows.

> **Audience:** Developers and AI agents building integrations with the CommerceOS API.

---

## What This Repository Is

This is a **high-level reference, example database and cookbook-style guide** for AI agents and developers who need broad contextual understanding of the CommerceOS API. It covers:

- Common workflows and task recipes
- Query patterns and operator usage
- Patterns for common integrations with CommerceOS
- Pitfalls and troubleshooting
- Practical curl examples

**Why no endpoint listings?** The API serves its own documentation at each deployed instance. Endpoint schemas and model definitions are always up-to-date there, so this repository focuses on the higher-level patterns that don't change between versions.

## Where to Find Documentation

| Location | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<base-uri>/api-docs` | **Tenant-specific docs** - human-friendly, always check here first |
| `<base-uri>/openapi/spec.json` | **OpenAPI spec** - machine-readable endpoints and model definitions |
| [dev.heads.com/api-docs](https://dev.heads.com/api-docs) | Global documentation (when no tenant available) |
| [dev.heads.com/openapi/spec.json](https://dev.heads.com/openapi/spec.json) | Global OpenAPI spec |

`<base-uri>` here is the URL to the running CommerceOS instance, for example `mycompany.app.heads.com`. `dev.heads.com` hosts a public such instance for public documentation.

**Best practice:** Use the tenant's documentation when available - it reflects the specific API version and configuration for that deployment.

## Common Patterns

### Query Operators

```bash
# Filter and paginate
GET /v1/products~where(status=Active)~take(10)

# Expand fields
GET /v1/products/com.example.sku=ABC~with(prices,categories)

# Project specific fields only
GET /v1/orders~just(identifiers,totalAmount,status)

# Apply mapped type transformation
GET /v1/receipts~map(com.heads.receipt-csv)
```

### External Identifiers

Resources support user-defined external identifiers using reverse-domain notation:

```bash
# Lookup by external ID
GET /v1/products/com.myapp.sku=WIDGET-001

# Create with external ID
PUT /v1/products
[{ "identifiers": { "com.myapp.sku": "WIDGET-001" }, "name": "Widget" }]
```

## Pitfalls

- Sync webhook `in` requests only use `url`; `method`, `headers`, and `body` are ignored, and `out.body` is ignored because sync webhooks always send the mapped item JSON.
- `~map` only accepts mapped type names, not inline selectors like `~map(name)`. Use `~just(...)` for simple projections or define a mapped type.
- `X-Request-Map` resolves selectors against raw JSON without type context, so path-based selectors can fail unless the input already matches API type structures; preprocess complex imports client-side.
- Query parameters are normalized into a fixed operator order; `orderby` runs before `offset/limit`, so sorting happens before pagination. If you need a different operator sequence, use path operators.
- Customer group membership is managed on trade relationships (`/v1/trade-relationships/{id}/groups`); `/v1/people|companies/{id}/customerGroups` lists groups owned by the agent, not membership.
- Place/stock place `parent` setters accept only database keys (`identifiers.key`), not external identifiers; fetch the key first via `/identifiers/key` before assigning parents.
- `fields=a,b` uses projection (`~just`/`~simpleJust`) unless `fields=all/none/default`; use `~with(...)` when you need expansion semantics.
- Operator chains run in URL order; rearranging operators can change results, so keep them in a logical sequence.
- `~orderBy` accepts a single selector; commas are treated as literal selector characters, so multi-field ordering is not supported.
- Receipt `/after`/`/before` cursor endpoints only accept Date-parsable timestamps; relative shorthands like `-=24` are not supported.
- Product category/group hierarchies do not accept a `parent` field or `/children` endpoints; use `childCategories` on the parent category and `parentGroup` + `members` on product group nodes.
- Product images are URL-keyed (`identifiers.url`) with no `altText`/`sortOrder` metadata; use URL-only image identifiers.
