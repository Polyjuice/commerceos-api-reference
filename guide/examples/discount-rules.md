## Discount Rule Anatomy

A discount rule defines **when** and **how** discounts apply. Key properties:

| Property | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `seller` / `buyer` | Scope the rule to specific sellers or buyer groups (e.g., employee customers). Use `include` arrays with identifier references. |
| `currency` | Restrict to specific currencies (e.g., `{"currencyCode": "SEK"}`). |
| `time` | Optional validity window with `start` and `end` dates (ISO format). |
| `phase` | Determines evaluation order. Rules in lower-priority phases apply first; higher-priority phases can stack on top. Include `identifiers`, `name`, and `priority`. |
| `items` | A **named map** of item groups. Each key (e.g., `"phone"`, `"plan"`) defines a group with `include`/`exclude` arrays and optional `atLeast`/`atMost` quantity constraints. |
| `where.equals` | Links item groups by matching property paths (e.g., ensuring a phone's IMEI matches a plan's phoneImei for bundle discounts). |
| `effects` | Array of effect objects. Each effect must include `@type`, which items it targets, and how it applies. |
| `effects[].@type` | Effect type: `"percentage discount rule effect"`, `"fixed reduction discount rule effect"`, `"fixed price discount rule effect"`, or `"package discount rule effect"`. |
| `effects[].items` | **Must reference keys from the `items` map** (e.g., `["phone"]` or `["item1", "item2"]`). |
| `effects[].multiplicity` | `"PerUnit"` (applies to each qualifying unit) or `"PerApplication"` (applies once per rule match). |
| `effects[].targeting` | `"All"` (affects all matching items), `"LowestValue"` (targets the cheapest item), or `"HighestValue"` (targets the most expensive item). |
| `effects[].minimumResultingPrice` | Floor price after discount (prevents negative prices). |
| `includesTax` | Whether the discount applies to tax-inclusive prices (`true`) or pre-tax prices (`false`). |
| `reason` | A reference to explain why the discount was applied (shown on receipts). |

## Example 1: Employee Apparel Percentage Discount (Category-Based)

This rule gives employees 10% off apparel products:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "employee-discount"},
    "name": "Employee apparel 10%",
    "seller": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "ourcompany"}}]},
    "buyer": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "employee-customers"}}]},
    "currency": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"currencyCode": "SEK"}}]},
    "phase": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "loyalty"}, "name": "Loyalty discounts", "priority": 300},
    "items": {
      "apparel": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "fashion-clothes"}}],
        "exclude": [],
        "atLeast": 1
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["apparel"],
      "percentage": "10",
      "multiplicity": "PerUnit",
      "targeting": "All"
    }],
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "employee-discount-reason"}, "name": "Employee discount"},
    "includesTax": false
  }'
```

## Example 2: Phone + Plan Subsidy with Bundle Link

This rule applies a fixed SEK 2,500 reduction when a phone and matching plan are purchased together. The `where.equals` ensures the phone's IMEI matches the plan's `phoneImei` property:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "phone-plan-subsidy"},
    "name": "Phone with plan subsidy",
    "seller": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "ourcompany"}}]},
    "currency": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"currencyCode": "SEK"}}]},
    "phase": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "subsidy"}, "name": "Subsidy", "priority": 200},
    "includesTax": true,
    "time": {"start": "2025-04-11", "end": "2035-12-11"},
    "items": {
      "phone": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "mobile-telephone-group"}}],
        "atLeast": 1,
        "atMost": 1
      },
      "plan": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "mobile-plans-group"}}],
        "atLeast": 1,
        "atMost": 1
      }
    },
    "where": {
      "equals": [
        "phone.MobileDevice::imei",
        "plan.MobilePlan::phoneImei"
      ]
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "fixed reduction discount rule effect",
      "items": ["phone"],
      "amount": "2500",
      "minimumResultingPrice": "1",
      "multiplicity": "PerApplication",
      "targeting": "All"
    }],
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "phone-plan-subsidy"}, "name": "Phone with plan"}
  }'
```

## Example 3: Pair Discount on Two Specific SKUs

This rule gives 25% off when two specific AirPods models are purchased together:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "buy-together"},
    "name": "AirPods pair discount",
    "seller": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "ourcompany"}}]},
    "currency": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"currencyCode": "SEK"}}]},
    "phase": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "custom"}, "name": "Custom", "priority": 500},
    "time": {"start": "2025-04-11", "end": "2035-12-11"},
    "items": {
      "item1": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "apple-airpods-3gen"}}],
        "exclude": [],
        "atLeast": 1,
        "atMost": 1
      },
      "item2": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "apple-airpods-2gen"}}],
        "exclude": [],
        "atLeast": 1,
        "atMost": 1
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["item1", "item2"],
      "percentage": "25",
      "multiplicity": "PerApplication",
      "targeting": "All"
    }],
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "pair-discount"}, "name": "Pair discount"}
  }'
```

## Example 4: Percentage Discount on Category (Campaign Promo)

A simple percentage-off campaign targeting all accessories:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "campaign-accessories-20"},
    "name": "Accessories 20% off",
    "seller": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "stockholm-store"}}]},

    }],
    "includesTax": false,
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "campaign"}, "name": "Campaign promo"}
  }'
```

## Example 5: Quantity Tier Discounts (Volume Breaks)

Two rules implement tiered pricing: 5% off at 3+ items, 10% off at 5+ items. Both rules use the same phase priority so they are evaluated together:

> **Note: How Overlapping Tier Rules Work**
>
> When multiple rules match the same instances (e.g., 5 items match both `atLeast: 3` and `atLeast: 5`), the discount engine evaluates possible outcomes and selects the one that **minimizes the total price** (maximizes the customer's discount). Rules within the same phase consume instances—once an instance is discounted by one rule, it's unavailable to other rules in that phase. This means:
>
> - **Overlapping tiers compete**, and each item can only be discounted once per phase.
> - The engine automatically picks the best outcome; with 5 items, it will apply the 10% tier (better discount) rather than the 5% tier.
> - **For deterministic tiers**, use explicit ranges: `atLeast: 3, atMost: 4` for tier 1 and `atLeast: 5` for tier 2—this ensures exactly one tier matches each quantity.
> - **To stack discounts**, place rules in separate phases with different priorities; each phase operates independently on all items.

```bash
# Tier 1: 5% off when buying 3+ items
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "items": {
      "cart": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "all-products"}}],
        "atLeast": 3
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["cart"],
      "percentage": "5",
      "multiplicity": "PerApplication",
      "targeting": "All"
    }],
    "includesTax": true
  }'

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "tier-5plus-10pct"},
    "name": "Buy 5+, get 10%",
    "phase": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "promotions"}, "name": "Promotions", "priority": 410},
    "items": {
      "cart": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "all-products"}}],
        "atLeast": 5
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["cart"],
      "percentage": "10",
      "multiplicity": "PerApplication",

    }],
    "includesTax": true
  }'
```

## Example 6: Bundle Deal (3-for-2)

The cheapest item is free when buying 3 from a category. Use `targeting: "LowestValue"` with 100% off:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "bundle-3for2"},
    "name": "3 for 2 on cosmetics",

    "items": {
      "bundle": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "cosmetics"}}],
        "atLeast": 3,
        "atMost": 3
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["bundle"],
      "percentage": "100",
      "multiplicity": "PerApplication",

    }],
    "includesTax": true,
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "bundle"}, "name": "3-for-2 bundle"}
  }'
```

## Example 7: Buy X Get Y Free

Buy 2 coffees, get a mug free. Two item groups with a 100% discount applied only to the reward item:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "coffee-mug-bogo"},

    "phase": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "promotions"}, "name": "Promotions", "priority": 320},
    "items": {
      "coffee": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "coffee-beans"}}],
        "atLeast": 2
      },
      "mug": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "ceramic-mug"}}],
        "atLeast": 1,
        "atMost": 1
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["mug"],
      "percentage": "100",
      "multiplicity": "PerApplication",
      "targeting": "LowestValue"
    }],
    "includesTax": true,
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "bogo"}, "name": "Buy X get Y"}
  }'
```

## Example 8: Store-Specific Discount

Clearance discount limited to a single store location using the `seller` scope:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "stockholm-clearance"},
    "name": "Stockholm clearance -15%",
    "seller": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "store-stockholm"}}]},
    "currency": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"currencyCode": "SEK"}}]},
    "items": {
      "clearance": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "clearance"}}],
        "atLeast": 1
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["clearance"],

    }],
    "includesTax": true,
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "clearance"}, "name": "Store clearance"}
  }'
```

---

## Example 9: Staff Discount with Floor Price

Employee discount using `buyer` scope. The `minimumResultingPrice` ensures the price never drops below a floor:

```bash
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/discount-rules" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "staff-apparel-30"},
    "name": "Staff apparel 30%",
    "buyer": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "employee-customers"}}]},
    "currency": {"include": [{"identifiers": {"currencyCode": "SEK"}}]},
    "items": {
      "apparel": {
        "include": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "fashion-clothes"}}],
        "atLeast": 1
      }
    },
    "effects": [{
      "@type": "percentage discount rule effect",
      "items": ["apparel"],
      "percentage": "30",
      "multiplicity": "PerUnit",
      "targeting": "All",
      "minimumResultingPrice": "99"
    }],
    "includesTax": false,
    "reason": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "staff"}, "name": "Staff discount"}
  }'
```

---

## Manual Discounts (Ad-Hoc at POS)

Manual discounts are applied directly to trade orders, not through discount rules. They are set on individual items at order creation time via the `manualDiscount` field:

```bash
# Create order with manual discount on an item
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/trade-orders" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.myapp.orderId": "ORD-001"},
    "supplier": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "ourcompany"}},
    "customer": {"identifiers": {"com.myapp.customerId": "CUST-001"}},
    "sellers": [{"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "store1"}}],
    "currency": {"identifiers": {"currencyCode": "SEK"}},
    "items": [
      {
        "product": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "iphone16"}},
        "quantity": 1,
        "manualDiscount": {"identifiers": {"com.heads.seedID": "loyalty-10pct"}}
      }
    ]
  }'

# Query order with manual discounts expanded
curl -X GET -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/trade-orders/com.myapp.orderId=ORD-001~with(manualDiscounts)"
```

> **Note:** Manual discounts are set at order creation; the `manualDiscount` field is read-only afterward. Check the `discountable` flag on items before applying.

---

## Trade Restrictions

```bash
# List trade restrictions
curl -X GET -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/trade-restrictions"

# List trade restriction reasons
curl -X GET -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/trade-restriction-reasons"

# Create trade restriction reason
curl -X POST -u ":banana" "localhost:5000/api/v1/trade-restriction-reasons" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "identifiers": {"com.myapp.reasonId": "AGE-RESTRICTED"},
    "name": "Age Restricted Product",
    "description": "Requires age verification before purchase"
  }'
```
